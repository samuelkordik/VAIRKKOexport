# vairkkoexport

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of vairkkoexport is to simplify extracting structured information from VAIRKKO. This exported information can then be saved for archival purposes or imported to other systems.

## Installation

You can install vairkkoexport from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
install_github("samuelkordik/vairkkoexport")
```

## Authentication with VAIRKKO
Using this package requires valid login credentials to VAIRKKO with access to the specific area you are exporting data from.

> **_NOTE:_** Use of this package is at your own risk. Only use this package with the approval of the VAIRKKO client organization.

Authentication is handled on package load.


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(vairkkoexport)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
